        <description>

As I speak with clients, I’m continually asked if it’s still possible to sell homes safely during the pandemic, given all the safety measures implemented by the government. Luckily, the answer is yes! Once the buyer has viewed your property online, we’ll then ask them to drive through the neighborhood to see if it all checks out. Before we begin phase two, we’ll make sure the buyer has a pre-approval letter from their lender, and both the buyer’s and seller’s agent will need to sign a new California Association of Realtors form that was specifically created for the pandemic called the Coronavirus Entry Form. To learn what it entails, as well as what comes during phase two of the process, watch this short video above.
